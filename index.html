                <p class="description">"I … call on the international community to continue and deepen engagements with Bangladesh in meeting our people’s quest for democracy, rule of law, equality, prosperity, so that we can emerge as a just and inclusive democratic society. We believe, the ‘monsoon revolution’ that the world witnessed in Bangladesh in the span of [a] few weeks, may inspire many across communities and countries, to stand for freedom and justice. Bangladesh was born because of her people’s profound belief in liberalism, pluralism, secularism. Decades later, our ‘Generation Z’ is making us re-visit and re-imagine the very values that our people … stood for in 1971. I stand in this parliament of nations thanks to an epochal transformation that Bangladesh witnessed this July and August. The ‘power of the ordinary people,’ in particular our youth, presented to our nation an opportunity to overhaul many of our systems and institutions. Our people, particularly youth, gained us independence from an autocratic and undemocratic regime with their exceptional resolve and capability. … This was indeed a movement that primarily brought together people who were long left in politics and development. Our youth and people together entrusted me and my colleagues in the Council with enormous responsibilities to re-construct a decaying state apparatus."</p>
